## A bit about us
---
Code Forum is a community that developers trust to help them exceed expectations. Where developers can learn, share and build their developer toolkit.

Our mission is to help each other learn, build and share using code. By providing a community that supports each other, through discussion & question-based threads, to providing resources that will give developers the upper hand on creating their project.
