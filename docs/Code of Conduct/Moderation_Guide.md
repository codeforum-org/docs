## Moderation Techniquesâ€‹
---
Code Forum always wants to be trasnparent, with that said, we want to show you how moderation will be carried out. Code of Conduct has been broken down into three main categories: Inappropriate Content, Inappropriate Behaviour/Language and Inappropriate Advertising / Spam with a few smaller categories. Each category warning will be given based on the rule that was broken.

### Glossary
Please review the glossary to help you better understand what certain abbreviations stand for:

   * AWP - <b>Active Warning Points</b>
   * IC - <b>Inappropriate Content</b>
   * IBL - <b>Inappropriate Behaviour/Language</b>
   * IAS - <b>Inappropriate Advertising / Spam</b>

It is advised that you review the table for new warnings and warning points:

* If an offender does not have ANY active warning points give a reminder for the first offence.
* If warning points active apply regular pointed warning.
* illegal content, hacking and or null scripts ban permanently. Notify admin.
* Child pornography, pornography ban permanently. Notify admin.
