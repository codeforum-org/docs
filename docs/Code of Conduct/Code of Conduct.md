## Inappropriate Content

1. When posting you need to be sure to add some value to your post. Add lots of information, explain yourself, make your posts enjoyable to read.
 * This shall include thread titles, or titles or resources, media items.
2. Make yourself understood. Use proper grammar to the best of your ability. We understand that English may not be everyone’s main language, but make an attempt. You won’t get in trouble for a misplaced comma or typos, but it would help everyone if you could make sure everyone understands your message.
3. Using people's content is okay with their consent if you were not permitted by the author of the original post/content will be removed and you shall be given a warning.
4. Posting illegal/null and or hacking scripts is prohibited (Hacking scripts will result in a permanent ban).
5. Any discussions regarding illegal hacking are prohibited. E.g. to take control and or access data without the permission of the owner.
6. No sharing inappropriate pictures.
7. Before posting a thread asking for help please review [Before asking your question](https://codeforum.org/threads/before-asking-your-question.321/#post-1716), [Q&A system has changed](https://codeforum.org/threads/code-forums-q-a-system-has-changed.617/) and [How to ask a good question](https://codeforum.org/threads/how-do-i-ask-a-good-question.5/).
8. Any posts that contain pornography and child pornography will be removed and your account will be permanently banned. Local authorities will be contacted.
9. When sharing or placing code in a thread/post please format the code using our BBCode to make it easier to read and understand by whoever is looking at your code. Check out the thread that was created about BBCode and examples on how to use it properly. [https://codeforum.org/threads/how-to-post-your-code-into-threads.183/](https://codeforum.org/threads/how-to-post-your-code-into-threads.183/)
10. Avoid posting threads and posts that contain a <b>wall of text</b>
    1. this is defined as posting a large paragraph or more)
    2. Suggestion: Instead format your post in such a way that it makes it interesting and understandable. It should be straight to the point and easy to read. Perhaps add some photos, bullet points, coloured font, code examples etc.
11. Avoid posting screenshots and or pictures of code. It makes it harder to come up with a solution to your question if we cannot copy and paste the code into our personal IDE's.
12. Do not post threads asking for coders to code and or build a program for you. You can request guidance, or team members to assist you but do NOT ask others to do the work for you.
13. Do not edit your original thread content and replace it with one-liners like "Solved" or "Nevermind" leave it as is, please reply to your thread stating that you have solved it and provide the solution.
14. Do not post any sensitive data on Code Forum that may either harm or put others in danger. Including but limited to sharing emails, passwords, sensitive government information such as SSN/SIN numbers, credit cards, addresses, phone numbers.
    1. If you are needing help with managing data with code or other methods then please use a tool such as [https://mockaroo.com/](https://mockaroo.com/) or something similar to generate this data for you, do NOT use production data. When you use randomly generated data, please specify in your thread where you got the data from.

## Inappropriate Behaviour/Language
---

1. Be respectful towards members' opinions and ideas they may have. It's fair to disagree and to have a different perspective, but present your case on why you disagree thoroughly.
2. When replying to other member's post try to stay on topic, although we will not penalize you, we strongly encourage you to not divert from the topic. E.g. the post is about HTML, but you decide to start talking about cats.
3. Use common sense. This includes but is not limited to avoiding spamming, being excessively rude or arguing against the staff members. If you have a conflict with a member or a staff member, contact the administration through a private message rather than having heated debates in the forum discussions. Avoid using Vulgar, offensive or otherwise obscene names towards staff or another member.
4. Unwelcoming behaviour is not tolerated at Code Forum; this is in regards to posts or replies where statements such as "Google it, search google" and or "that's a stupid question" will result in a warning. We are a community, we help each other, encourage each other.
5. Do NOT just answer a question; give an explanation, facts, share some examples. Code Forum is about learning, we must help each other learn.
6. Do not use 'bump' within 24 hours of thread creation, and or if the post has not had any activity for 24 hours.
    1. Modifying and or changing a topic and posting a reply with information DOES NOT count toward a bump.
    2. Example: You posted about needing help with C++ but figured out part of your problem before anyone could help you, then you may post a reply.
        1. Use 'bump' when you have nothing further to add but wish to bring your or another thread back to the top for more information and or an answer to the thread.
7. If you have more than one account and one of them is banned - then all accounts under your IP address will be banned as it will be taken as you are evading a ban. However, in special circumstances, you may be given an exemption which must be approved by an Administrator.

## Inappropriate Advertising / Spam
---
1. Please do not advertise other developing communities at Code Forum. You may, however, reference a resource or a tutorial/guide.
    1. This may also include:
        1. Services and or products you (others) provide.​
2. Do not promote sites on Code Forum; this may include but not limited to forum threads, profile posts, private messaging and or any other affiliation to Code Forum.
    1. However, if you are seeking help with your website, app or any other development then you can share a link to help you and others solve your issue.
3. When providing links to solutions or articles; please explain the context of the link. The right way of sharing links would be: [https://codeforum.org](https://codeforum.org) is where you can get help with coding! <b>NOT</b> [https://codeforum.org](https://codeforum.org). Visitors and coders should know where the link is going to direct them.
    1. OPTIONAL: Share the solution/content within the thread followed by the source URL. This will help reduce the amount of clicks for coders when trying to find their solution.

## Resources & Media Services
---
1. All media and or resources published to resources/media must be approved by an administrator before it can be seen publicly.
2. Any posts that contain pornography and child pornography will be removed and your account will be permanently banned. Local authorities will be contacted.

4. If you plan on buying resources be sure that the resource exists first and that it meets your expectations.
    1. Report if you get scammed to administration immediately and contact your bank; scamming will result in account restriction.
5. Posting of 'paid' services and goods is prohibited. We are a free community.

## Participating in Events & Contests
